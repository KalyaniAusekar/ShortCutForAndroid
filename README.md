# ShortCutForAndroid

Create shortcuts for app. 
 3 ways to show shortcuts
 
  a -> static -> defined in a resource file that is packaged into an APK or app bundle.
  Are best for apps that link to content using a consistent structure throughout the lifetime of a user's interaction with the app.
  
  b -> dynamic -> can be pushed, updated, and removed by your app only at runtime.
  Used for actions in apps that are context-sensitive. Context-sensitive shortcuts are tailored to the actions users perform in an app. 
  
  c -> Pinned -> can be added to supported launchers at runtime, if the user grants permission.
   used for specific, user-driven actions. 
   It allows the user to perform a custom action, like navigating to the website in one step, more quickly than using a default instance of a browser.
