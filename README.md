# ShortCutForAndroid

Create shortcuts for app. 
 3 ways to show shortcuts
  a -> static -> defined in a resource file that is packaged into an APK or app bundle.
  
  b -> dynamic -> can be pushed, updated, and removed by your app only at runtime.
  
  c -> Pinned -> can be added to supported launchers at runtime, if the user grants permission.
